rollup background.js --file bundle.js --format iife

A Chrome browser extension that shows the cache hit ratio for objects on
a page served by Fastly.

When you navigate to a page that is served by Fastly, a little red
percentage symbol is highlighted in the toolbar to the right of the
omnibox. As the browser loads all the objects on that page from the
